# PCE V0 Release Notes

## Status

Achieved. V0 is ready for deploy.

## Smoke test summary

- Create Project in-app -> Launch -> Finish.
- Project list updates and groups by status.
- Active project cap enforced on Launch.
- GitHub OAuth connect -> import repos -> drafts list -> convert to project.
- Sign in/out and protected routing verified.

## What works

- Create Project UI with server-side persistence.
- Project list grouped by status and detail editing.
- Lifecycle actions with server-side validation.
- Active project cap enforcement.
- GitHub OAuth connect, repo import, drafts list, conversion to project.

## What is intentionally missing / current gaps

- GitHub repo pagination (only most recent 100).
- Bulk create and templates.
- Advanced validation UX.
- Multi-user / org support.
- Automation and analytics.

## V0 finish definition check

- Create/run/close a project with explicit Launch -> Finish: Achieved.
- Max 3 active projects enforced: Achieved.
- At least 1 real project completed using PCE: Pending manual confirmation.

## Feedback

V0 is usable end-to-end without manual DB work. Main limitation is GitHub repo pagination (100 max).

## Next steps

- Add GitHub repo pagination.
- Add templates/bulk import and onboarding improvements.
- Evaluate dispersion reduction with real usage data.
