# PCE V0 Release Notes

## Status

Not achieved. The V0 finish definition was not met.

## Smoke test summary

- Manual smoke test attempted for Epic 1 flows.
- Project creation is not available in the UI; it required direct DB insert.
- Lifecycle actions (Launch/Freeze/Archive/Finish) work on existing records, but the end-to-end flow was not completed in-app.

## What works

- Project list grouped by status.
- Project detail editing for core fields.
- Lifecycle actions with server-side validation.
- Active project cap enforcement.

## What is intentionally missing / current gaps

- Create Project UI (blocking for real use).
- GitHub import (Epic 2).
- Automation and analytics.

## V0 finish definition check

- Create/run/close a project with explicit Launch -> Finish: Not achieved.
- Max 3 active projects enforced: Achieved.
- At least 1 real project completed using PCE: Not achieved.
- Dispersion reduction: Not evaluated (no completed real project).

## Feedback

The absence of a Create Project flow makes the system feel too constrained; only lifecycle actions are accessible without manual DB work.

## Next steps

- Add Create Project UI and onboarding for the first project.
- Re-run the smoke test with a real project once creation is in-app.
