# PCE V1.1 Release Notes

## Status

Achieved. V1.1 is ready for deploy.
Closed on 2026-01-24.

## Smoke test summary

- Freeze and Finish require a snapshot; Archive does not.
- Snapshots appear in project detail.
- Active cap override opens ritual and enforces freeze + decision.
- Weekly Review Mode blocks until decisions are applied to all active projects.
- Stale detection triggers review when last_reviewed_at is older than 7 days.
- System state header shows counts and active cap.
- Smoke test passed on 2026-01-24.

## What works

- Snapshot capture enforced for Freeze and Finish with atomic backend actions.
- Snapshot list visible on project detail.
- Active cap override ritual with required decision and snapshot.
- Stable ACTIVE_CAP_REACHED error code for cap enforcement.
- Weekly Review Mode with required decisions per active project.
- last_reviewed_at tracking and stale detection.
- Minimal system state header on dashboard.

- Review Mode only targets active projects.

## Next steps

- Extend Review Mode with optional prompts and per-project notes.
